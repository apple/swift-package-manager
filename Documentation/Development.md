# Development

This document contains information on building and testing the Swift Package Manager.

## Using Swift compiler build script

The official way to build and test is using the Swift compiler build script.
First, follow the instructions provided
[here](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) and
then run one of these commands from the Swift Package Manager directory:

##### macOS:

```sh
$ ../swift/utils/build-script -R --llbuild --swiftpm
```

##### Linux:

```sh
$ ../swift/utils/build-script -R --llbuild --swiftpm --xctest --foundation --libdispatch
```

This will build compiler and friends in `build/` directory. It takes about ~1
hour for the initial build process. However, it is not really required to build
the entire compiler in order to work on the Package Manager. A faster option is
using a [snapshot](https://swift.org/download/#releases) from swift.org.

## Using trunk snapshot

1. [Download](https://swift.org/download/#snapshots) and install latest Trunk Development snapshot.
2. Run the following command depending on your platform.

	### macOS
	```sh
	$ export TOOLCHAINS=swift
	# Verify that we're able to find the swift compiler from the installed toolchain.
	$ xcrun --find swift
	/Library/Developer/Toolchains/swift-latest.xctoolchain/usr/bin/swift
	```
	### Linux
	```sh
	$ export PATH=/path/to/swift-toolchain/usr/bin:"${PATH}"
	# Verify that we're able to find the swift compiler from the installed toolchain.
	$ which swift
	/path/to/swift-toolchain/usr/bin/swift
	```

3. Clone [llbuild](https://github.com/apple/swift-llbuild) next to the package manager directory.

    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/apple/swift-llbuild llbuild
    $ ls
    swiftpm llbuild
    ```

    Note: Make sure the directory for llbuild is called "llbuild" and not
    "swift-llbuild".
 
4. Building the Swift Package Manager.

	```sh
	$ cd swiftpm
	$ Utilities/bootstrap
	```

    Note: The bootstrap script requires having [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) installed. Please refer to the [Swift project repo](https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/README.md#macos) for installation instructions.
	
    This command will build the Package Manager inside `.build/` directory.
    Run the bootstrap script to rebuild after making a change to the source
    code.
	
    You can also use the built binaries: `swift-build`, `swift-package`,
    `swift-test`, `swift-run`.
	
	### Example:
	```sh
	$ cd /tmp && mkdir hello && cd hello
	$ /path/to/swiftpm/.build/x86_64-apple-macosx/debug/swift-package init
	$ /path/to/swiftpm/.build/x86_64-apple-macosx/debug/swift-build
	```

5. Testing the Swift Package Manager.

	```sh
	$ Utilities/bootstrap test --test-parallel
	```
	Use this command to run the tests. All tests must pass before a patch can be accepted.

## Self-hosting

It is possible to build SwiftPM with itself using a special script that is
emitted during bootstrapping. This is useful when you want to rebuild just the
sources or run a single test. Make sure you run the bootstrap script first.

```sh
$ cd swiftpm

# Rebuild just the sources.
$ .build/x86_64-apple-macosx/debug/spm build

# Run a single test.
$ .build/x86_64-apple-macosx/debug/spm test --filter BasicTests.GraphAlgorithmsTests/testCycleDetection
```

Note: If you make any changes to `PackageDescription` runtime-related targets,
you **will** need to rebuild using the bootstrap script.

## Developing using Xcode

Run the following command to generate a Xcode project.

```sh
$ Utilities/bootstrap --generate-xcodeproj
generated: ./SwiftPM.xcodeproj
$ open SwiftPM.xcodeproj
```

Note: If you make any changes to `PackageDescription` or `PackageDescription4`
target, you will need to regenerate the Xcode project using the above command.

## Continuous Integration

SwiftPM uses [swift-ci](https://ci.swift.org) infrastructure for its continuous integration testing. The
bots can be triggered on pull-requests if you have commit access, otherwise ask
one of the code owners to trigger them for you. The following commands are supported:

### @swift-ci please smoke test

Run tests with trunk compiler and other projects. This is **required** before
a pull-request can be merged.

### @swift-ci test with toolchain

Run tests with latest trunk snapshot. This has fast turnaround times so it can
be used to get quick feedback.

Note: Smoke tests are still required for merging the pull-requests.

## Running the performance tests

Running performance tests is a little awkward right now. First, generate the
Xcode project using this command:

```sh
$ Utilities/bootstrap --generate-xcodeproj --enable-perf-tests
```

Then, open the generated project and run the `PerformanceTest` scheme.

## Testing on Linux with Docker

For contributors on macOS who need to test on Linux, install Docker and use the
following commands:

```sh
$ Utilities/Docker/docker-utils build # will build an image with the latest swift snapshot
$ Utilities/Docker/docker-utils bootstrap # will bootstrap SwiftPM on the linux container
$ Utilities/Docker/docker-utils run bash # to run an interactive bash shell in the container
$ Utilities/Docker/docker-utils swift-build # to run swift-build in the container
$ Utilities/Docker/docker-utils swift-test # to run swift-test in the container
$ Utilities/Docker/docker-utils swift-run # to run swift-run in the container
```

## Using custom Swift compilers

SwiftPM needs Swift compiler to parse Package.swift manifest files and to
compile Swift source files. You can use `SWIFT_EXEC` and `SWIFT_EXEC_MANIFEST`
environment variables to control which compiler to use for these operations.

`SWIFT_EXEC_MANIFEST`: This variable controls which compiler to use for parsing
Package.swift manifest files. The lookup order for the manifest compiler is:
SWIFT_EXEC_MANIFEST, swiftc adjacent to swiftpm binaries, SWIFT_EXEC

`SWIFT_EXEC`: This variable controls which compiler to use for compiling Swift
sources. The lookup order for the sources compiler is: SWIFT_EXEC, swiftc adjacent
to swiftpm binaries. This is also useful for Swift compiler developers when they
want to use a debug compiler with SwiftPM.

```sh
$ SWIFT_EXEC=/path/to/my/built/swiftc swift build
```

## Overriding path to the runtime libraries

SwiftPM computes the path of runtime libraries relative to where it is
installed. This path can be overridden by setting the environment variable
`SWIFTPM_PD_LIBS` to a directory containing the libraries. This can be a list of
absolute search paths separated by colon (":"). SwiftPM will choose the first
path which exists on disk. If none of the path are present on disk, it will fall
back to built-in computation.

## Skip SwiftPM tests

SwiftPM has a hidden env variable `_SWIFTPM_SKIP_TESTS_LIST` that can be used
to skip a list of tests. This value of the variable is either a file path that contains a
new-line separated list of tests to skip or a colon separated list of tests.

This is only a development feature and should be considered _unsupported_.

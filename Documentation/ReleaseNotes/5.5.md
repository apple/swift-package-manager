# SwiftPM 5.5 Release Notes

### Package Collections

You can now use package collections to discover, manage, and publish curated lists of packages. Package collections are authored as static JSON documents and can be published to the web or distributed to local file systems. SwiftPM and Xcode locally share the same package collections, so either interface can manage your added collections.

To try the official Apple Swift Packages collection, run:

```
swift package-collection add https://developer.apple.com/swift/packages/collections/apple.json
```

Then, to see which packages are included in that collection and can now be imported in your code, run:

```
swift package-collection describe https://developer.apple.com/swift/packages/collections/apple.json
```

For more information about usage and how to publish your own package collections, see the [Package Collections documentation](../PackageCollections.md).

### Other improvements

Improved target-based dependency resolution. A more intuitive `.product(name:, package:)` syntax is now accepted, where `package` is the package name as defined by the package URL. (65048461)

Fixed an issue where resolution of packages with binary dependencies failed to extract the binary archive. (77011310)

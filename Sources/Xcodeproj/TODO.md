The following features are welcome, please submit a PR:

* Our references should remain human readable, but they aren't unique enough, eg. if a module is called ProxyFoo then the TargetProxy for Foo will conflict with the Target for ProxyFoo
* “Blue Folder” everything not part of the build
* Split out tests and non-tests in Products group
* Allow frameworks instead of dylibs and add a command line toggle
* Add .txt etc. to groups
* List modules in topological dependency order
* Escape all strings

// The way in which SwiftPM communicates with the plugin is an implementation
// detail, but the way it currently works is that the plugin is compiled (in
// a very similar way to the package manifest) and then run in a sandbox.
//
// Currently the plugin input is provided in the form of a JSON-encoded input
// structure passed as the last command line argument; however, this will very
// likely change so that it is instead passed on `stdin` of the process that
// runs the plugin, since that avoids any command line length limitations.
//
// Any generated commands and diagnostics are emitted on `stdout` after a zero
// byte; this allows regular output, such as print statements for debugging,
// to be emitted to SwiftPM verbatim. SwiftPM tries to interpret any stdout
// contents after the last zero byte as a JSON encoded output struct in UTF-8
// encoding; any failure to decode it is considered a protocol failure.
//
// The exit code of the compiled plugin determines success or failure (though
// failure to decode the output is also considered a failure to run the ex-
// tension).

// The way in which SwiftPM communicates with the package plugin is an im-
// plementation detail, but the way it currently works is that the plugin
// is compiled (in a very similar way to the package manifest) and then run in
// a sandbox. Currently it is passed the JSON encoded input structure as the
// last command line argument; however, it this will likely change to instead
// read it from stdin, since that avoids any command line length limitation.
// Any generated commands and diagnostics are emitted on stdout after a zero
// byte; this allows regular output, such as print statements for debugging,
// to be emitted to SwiftPM verbatim. SwiftPM tries to interpret any stdout
// contents after the last zero byte as a JSON encoded output struct in UTF-8
// encoding; any failure to decode it is considered a protocol failure. The
// exit code of the compiled plugin determines success or failure (though
// failure to decode the output is also considered a failure to run the ex-
// tension).
